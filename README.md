Frog Backend Programming Test
Design and implement a RESTful API (including data model and the backing implementation) for a bookstore. It should include basic CRUD for book with create, read, update, and delete operations. Read should include both fetching a single item and list of items.
Explicit requirements:
1. You can use any Java based technology (Java, Scala, Kotlin etc.).
2. Keep it simple and to the point (e.g. no need to implement any authentication).
3. You can use frameworks/libraries like Spring
4. You can use in memory database like H2 if you like
5. The final result should be executable as a standalone program (should not require a pre-installed container/server).
6. Demonstrate with tests that the API works as expected.
Implicit requirements:
1. The code is expected to be of high quality.
2. There are no detailed requirements, use common sense and make assumptions if you need to.
Please put your work on github or bitbucket and share with us.
